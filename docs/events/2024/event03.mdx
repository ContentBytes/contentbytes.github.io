# #03 | Let's talk knowledge and skills

Though the weather outside is frightful, Content Bytes is (as always) delightful :) We know that a warm blanket and tea sound like a solution, but so does our meetup! Join us for a cozy session focused on knowledge.

## Topics and speakers

üëâ **A newcomer's perspective: My technical writing internship journey & new outlook for buddies**

Entering the world of technical writing can feel intimidating, especially for those without prior experience. In this talk, I'll share my journey as a technical writing intern, offering insights into key areas like learning best practices, mastering documentation tools, and developing the interpersonal skills that make all the difference in this role.

This talk serves a dual purpose: I'll use personal stories to provide valuable takeaways for both newcomers and buddies. For newcomers, it's an opportunity to connect over shared experiences and lessons learned. For buddies, it offers a chance to understand the expectations and challenges faced by those new to technical writing, helping to foster more effective mentorship.

Ma≈Çgorzata is a first-year Master's student in Applied Informatics. In September, she graduated with a Bachelor's degree in the same field. :) Ma≈Çgorzata secured her first internship as a Technical Writer in the second year of her Bachelor's studies, despite having no prior knowledge of the industry or preparation for this profession from her studies. As part of the second internship and current employment, she has been working at IBM for almost a year. She has always enjoyed working with language, conducting research, and being creative. Combined with the skills she acquired during studies, this has created the perfect combination. In her free time, Ma≈Çgorzata likes to watch Korean dramas to learn a bit of a new language, and paint beautiful landscapes by numbers.

üëâ **How to turn your know-how into money-attracting content
(without losing your mind)**

Let's be direct: technical expertise alone isn't enough anymore. You're sitting on a goldmine of knowledge, but if nobody knows about it, you're leaving money on the table.

I will show you how you can turn your insights into content that attracts business opportunities. All of that using simple systems that work even when you're swamped with daily tasks. Based on my real experience you will also learn about proven frameworks, strategic use of AI in the process, and my personal favorite - the mindset shifts that no automation can replace.

No theoretical fluff. No complex strategies. Just practical methods that have helped me and my clients go from '47 unfinished drafts' and 'everything's been said before' to becoming visible and in demand.
