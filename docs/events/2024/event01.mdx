# #01 | Let's talk content

Summer might be over, but the ContentBytes team is working hard to turn up the heat with some sizzling hot content topics! 

This October, we bring you not one, but two presentations bridging the world of technical communication and UX. During the meeting, we will explore the world of API docs and discuss the future of tech writers in the world of content.

## Topics and speakers

👉 **The whys and hows of API Documentation**

The topic of API documentation always sparks interest in the content world.

- Who writes API documentation and how?
- How to organize the content to make it meaningful and helpful? 
- What standards should tech writers follow?

A few examples of API docs will help us explore how an idea for a new API becomes fully-documented API specification.
As we go through the process, we will discuss tools, documentation approaches, and cooperation best practices.

by **Barbara Czyż**

Barbara is a curious technical writer, passionate about the docs-as-code approach and the API world. After her adventures with DITA and Markdown, she joined Box to create developer documentation and tighten her relationship with APIs and code. She is also a co-organizer of ContentBytes.

👉 **Evolution and future of writer roles in product development**

Content, similar to other terms, brings different associations in different minds. In his presentation, Paweł will talk about how content is perceived depending on the company, team, or a moment in time, and, of course, CONTEXT. Also how we, as content folks, can keep leveraging the circumstances to our benefit, and obviously, to the benefit of the company.

by **Paweł Chłodnicki**

Paweł is currently working as a Content Designer at Docplanner (ZnanyLekarz), doing both UX Content and Product Design. He took his first professional steps 15 years ago in translation and localisation, both as an IC and as a founder of a small yet global agency. He began his journey in IT as a technical writer (and whatnot) in a startup. Paweł is also a co-organizer of Content Bytes.
