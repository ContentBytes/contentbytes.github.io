## Topics and speakers

üëâ **How I try to bring order to chaos: unifying docs, tools, and tone in a startup**

Joining a startup as its first technical writer is like being handed a puzzle with half the pieces missing ‚Äî and some of them are on fire. In this talk, I'll share my (ongoing) quest to wrangle scattered docs, tame inconsistent tone, and introduce tools to keep things from spiraling further into chaos. It's messy, iterative, and never truly ‚Äùdone‚Äù‚Äî but that's the fun of it, I guess ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.
If you've ever felt like a lone writer in a wild docs frontier, this one's for you! Come for the chaos, stay for the ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.

üëâ Content writing is your accessibility superpower

Content writers have the power to become champions for digital inclusion, shaping a web that truly welcomes everyone. We've heard about inclusive, plain language, but there's so much more that lies deep within the code. Let's talk about the invisible microcopy that some users rely on, delve into the localization process, and explore what the WCAG standard offers as guidance.
