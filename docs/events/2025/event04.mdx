# #04 | Let's talk language

New Year, new me‚Ä¶etups! üéâ 

Our New Year's resolution is to cover versatile topics and bring you the best speakers! What's yours? If ‚Äúattending more meetups‚Äù is the answer, you can start right away! 

Let's meet to discuss how being a non-native speaker translates (pun intended) into the way we create content.

## Topics and speakers

üëâ **Navigating the English content market as a non-native speaker**

What does it take for non-native speakers to thrive in the English content market? Do we need native-level proficiency? What about AI, is it likely to secure or sabotage our ambitions? In this talk, we'll explore the pros and cons of creating content in our second language.

üëâ **Polski or English? Using your full potential as a multilingual content professional**

You made it to a non-native content person? Congratulations! Now, let's talk about working in all languages you know. I will share my experience navigating English, Polish, and Spanish-speaking markets, as well as some tips for making the most out of your potential if you speak multiple languages.
