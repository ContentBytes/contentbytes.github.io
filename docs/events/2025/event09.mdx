# #09 | Let's talk quality!

Content Bytes invites you to the last meetup before the vacation break! We've prepared another set of engaging topics, ensuring you have some content (pun intended) to think about even when you're relaxing at the beach üèñÔ∏è.

Our speakers from [neptune.ai][neptune] will discuss how metrics and AI can lead our way to better content.

## Topics and speakers

üëâ **Measure your docs quality with analytics**

Content creators often end up with more questions than answers. One way to mute the constant flow of unwarranted opinions, is to base your decisions on the measurable numbers and user behavior.
In this presentation, I'll share the learnings from using analytics tools at neptune.ai. Together, we'll look into metrics that are worth tracking, analyze the actual data, and see how this approach has transformed the Neptune docs.

After a couple of years of translating boiler construction diagrams and other similarly fascinating texts, Edyta switched to creating software documentation and never looked back. Currently, she works as a senior technical writer at neptune.ai. After hours, Edyta is also a co-organizer of the Content Bytes meetups and the upcoming CAKE conf.

üëâ **Let the bots write the boilerplate: AI in developer documentation**

As technical writers and developer advocates, we spend valuable time crafting and refining code snippets, tutorials, and examples‚Äîespecially the repetitive, boilerplate-heavy parts. What if AI could take on the grunt work so we can focus on clarity, creativity, and correctness?
In this talk, we'll explore how AI tools like ChatGPT and Cursor can be integrated into the technical writing workflow to brainstorm, generate, and fine-tune developer examples. You'll learn how to create human-in-the-loop processes where AI handles the repetition, and you apply the critical thinking. Whether you're working on SDK docs, API tutorials, or notebooks, this session will give you practical strategies to speed up your writing and improve your output‚Äîwithout compromising quality.
