# #06 | Let's talk teams!

Spring is here! 

Admit that you can't wait to go outside, take a breath of fresh air, enjoy the first warm days, and finally clean some windows. ðŸ§¹ Although our next meetup isn't about spring cleaning, it will definitely help you to get organized.

## Topics and speakers

ðŸ‘‰ **From silos to synergy**

As the IT industry evolves, so does the recognition of content's role in digital products. Companies are hiring more communication specialists, regulations around language are increasing, and UX writing is becoming a core process in many organizations. But as these roles &ndash; UX writers, researchers, designers, and managers &ndash; become more distinct, we risk creating silos instead of seamless collaboration.
How can content designers better integrate with IT teams? How can we make daily workflows smoother and foster true synergy? Let's explore these questions together in this talk!

by **Zuzanna Szott**

Zuzanna is a content designer, researcher, and sociologist. By day, she crafts UX Writing at XTB; by night, she co-hosts the Babskie Sprawy podcast and is passionate about technology and politics.

ðŸ‘‰ **Shocking discovery: self-organized distributed teams actually exist!**

Flexibility comes with responsibility. Remote work enabled us to work asynchronously from different locations but it also created new challenges that didn't exist in offices. In this case study, I want to show you how a distributed team can self-organize to thrive in the virtual work environment.
