# #07 | Let's talk ContentOps!

If you are embedded in IT, you have probably heard about DevOps.  If you are an action movie fan, SpecialOps also sounds familiar. So what comes to your mind when the term ‚ÄúContentOps‚Äù pops up? 

If it makes you imagine content creators storming buildings in search of potential violators of Microsoft Manual of Style, you better join the next Content Bytes meetup!

Shortly after Pawe≈Ç's presentation, we'll hold a brainstorming session to discuss ContentOps on the spot. 

## Topics and speakers

üëâ **What's Content Ops and why should I care?**

There are many sides to publishing content and there are many roles involved. This presentation collects them all under the umbrella of ContentOps. After an overview of the term, we go into how you can use this knowledge to build better content and hopefully take a more meaningful approach to your career.

by **Pawe≈Ç Kowaluk**

Pawe≈Ç has been in tech content since 2008. He's worked as a tech writer, product owner, team leader, programmer, technical director, consultant, information architect, and more. His focus right now is on ContentOps and the various interactions that go into it. He works as a tool developer at Guidewire Software. He is also a co-owner of [techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl) and [techwriterkoduje.pl][https://techwriterkoduje.pl].
