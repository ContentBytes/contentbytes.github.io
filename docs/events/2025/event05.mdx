# #05 | Let's talk style guides!

February, the month of love! üíö 

Apart from our very obvious affection for content, we love having guests in Krak√≥w! This time, we host a strong representation of content enthusiasts travelling  from Wroc≈Çaw.

## Topics and speakers

üëâ **Not your dad's style guide: The Content Design Guide**

Do software developers actually enjoy writing? Do technical writers really follow their own style guides? How much tool configuration is needed in a style guide? What are the non-negotiables for clear, effective writing? Who are these mysterious "language geeks" (probably hoarding grammar memes)? And what's with the cat pictures?!

Whether you're a developer looking to level up your writing skills or a writer eager to bridge the gap with tech folks, this is your chance to rethink the role of a style guide. Together, let's make documentation a little less daunting‚Äîand a lot more effective‚Äîone sentence at a time.
